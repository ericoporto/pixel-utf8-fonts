Commercial Use
A user has asked if GNU Unifont can be used with commercial (non-free) software. The answer is yes. The GNU Font Embedding Exception and the SIL OFL allow for that. See the next section for details. The main purpose of the licensing is to require derivative fonts that others create to be released to the public under the same licensing terms, not to prohibit the use of those fonts with certain software. Thus, preserving the license terms in derivative fonts provides a public benefit. The licenses also provide acknowledgement of previous Unifont contributors for their volunteer work.
